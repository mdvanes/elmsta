# Elmsta

## Purpose

Testing out Elm and answering questions like:

* How does it integrate into e.g. a pre-existing angular environment?
* Can I reuse any testing tools like Karma/Testing or is there an alternative?
* How do modules work? Can I use Webpack? 
* Integrating Bootstrap (elm bootstrap)
* If Elm can compile to JavaScript, can it be used on the back-end? Would this make any sense?
* Integrating Reactive Extensions?
* Integrating State containers (e.g. Redux)
